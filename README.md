This project presents a data leakage detection system using various allocation 
strategies and which assess the likelihood that the leaked data came from one or more agents. For secure transactions, allowing only
authorized users to access sensitive data through access control policies shall prevent data leakage by sharing information only with
trusted parties and also the data should be detected from leaking by means of adding fake record`s in the data set and which improves
probability of identifying leakages in the system.
